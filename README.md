# File-Encoder
Encodes any .py file

# Warning: This encoder doesn't obfuscate your code, doesn't make it smaller and doesn't make your file easier to read.

# How to encode your file
```
from main import *
x = encode_file("data.txt") # this encodes your file, it cannot be run
y = decode_file_data(x) # this decodes x, you can run this!

print(y) # same as data.txt, no null characters or missing letters!

# to execute your file:
exec(y)


```
# Example: goat.py
